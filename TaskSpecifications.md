## Introduction
Welcome to *Cowboy Rob's Carpet Calculator*! Let's get started ðŸ¤ 

Open your `script.js` file to see where you'll write your code. It looks like this:

```js
function calculateCarpet() {
  // ðŸ‘‡ Write your code here ðŸ‘‡

  // console.log("click");

}
```

## Deliverable
Your task is to retrieve the room dimensions a user enters and calculate the square footage of carpet needed to cover **both rooms INCLUDING 10% EXTRA.** Once you've calculated the square footage, you'll display that value on the page. 

We've included a few functions in the starter code to help you get the job done. Read on to learn more!

## Provided Functions
You'll need to use each of the following functions to get get the job done.

<hr>

1. **`getRoomWidth(roomNumber)`**

This function accepts a room number (either `1` or `2`) between its parentheses. The function will return the number a user typed into the width input for the room you specify (`1` for Room 1 or `2` for Room 2). On the page, type a number  in the width input for Room 1. Then, type `getRoomWidth(1)` in your console and press enter to see how it works. 
<hr>

2. **`getRoomLength(roomNumber)`**

This function works just like `getRoomWidth` but for the room's length. Type something into the length input for Room 1, then type `getRoomLength(1)` in your console and press enter to confirm how it works. 
<hr>

3. **`showResult(result)`**

This function accepts a number between its parentheses. You'll use this function to display the total square footage to the user once you've calculated it. Try running `showResult(255)` in the console and take a look at the page afterwards.

## Level Up! (Extra Credit)
Feel like taking things to the next level? Choose one (or both!) of the optional level ups below to snag some extra credit:

1. Head over to `provided.js`. Select two different provided functions and read over the code for each one. Leave comments at the bottom of  `script.js` that explain how these functions work in your own words. 
2. If you're feeling creative, write some custom CSS to add your own flair to the page. Leave a comment describing what you did in `script.js` so your grader can recognize your hard work! 

Good luck and happy coding. You got this!
